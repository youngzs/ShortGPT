## Framework overview

- 🎬 The `ContentShortEngine` is designed for creating shorts, handling tasks from script generation to final rendering, including adding YouTube metadata.

- 🎥 The `ContentVideoEngine` is ideal for longer videos, taking care of tasks like generating audio, automatically sourcing background video footage, timing captions, and preparing background assets.

- 🗣️ The `ContentTranslationEngine` is designed to dub and translate entire videos, from mainstream languages to more specific target languages. It takes a video file, or youtube link, transcribe it's audio, translates the content, voices it in a target language, adds captions , and gives back a new video, in a totally different language.

- 🎞️ The automated `EditingEngine`, using Editing Markup Language and JSON, breaks down the editing process into manageable and customizable blocks, comprehensible to Large Language Models.

💡 ShortGPT offers customization options to suit your needs, from language selection to watermark addition.

🔧 As a framework, ShortGPT is adaptable and flexible, offering the potential for efficient, creative content creation.
